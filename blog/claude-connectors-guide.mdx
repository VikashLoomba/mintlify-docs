## TL;DR
You’ll (1) deploy or pick an MCP server on **Cloud MCP**, (2) add it to **Claude** as a Claude Connector, (3) toggle **Claude Connectors** tools, and (4) prompt Claude to use your Connectors in a chat.

---

## Prerequisites

- A **Cloud MCP** account with at least one deployed MCP server (e.g., Playwright, Desktop Commander, or any server from the registry).
- A **Claude** account with **MCP** support and **Connectors** available in your workspace.
- You’re comfortable approving an OAuth flow when Claude connects to your Cloud MCP server.

> Tip: Cloud MCP exposes **OAuth-protected Remote (HTTP) MCP** endpoints. Claude never sees your Cloud MCP credentials; it just calls the server’s tools over the OAuth session.

# How to Use Claude Connectors with Cloud MCP (Video + Guide)

---

## 1) Pick (or deploy) an MCP server on Cloud MCP

1. Open Cloud MCP → **Servers** and choose a server that fits your task (e.g., a search or code-aware tool).
2. If needed, provide env vars/secrets and click **Deploy**. Wait until the server is **Healthy**.
3. Go to the server details page and locate and click the **Copy URL** button.

## 2) Add the Cloud MCP Connector to Claude (Remote HTTP MCP)

1. In Claude, open **Settings → Connectors**.

2. Choose **Add Custom Connector**.

3. Paste the Cloud MCP server URL (the OAuth-protected endpoint that Cloud MCP provides).
4. Approve the **Cloud MCP OAuth** screen when prompted.
5. After a successful handshake, you should see the tools listed in the chat window; expand it to confirm.

> If tools don’t appear: re-open the connection panel, confirm URL in Cloud MCP, and retry the OAuth approval.

## 4) Use your Cloud MCP Claude Connector Tools!

---

## 6) Troubleshooting

- **MCP tools don’t appear in Claude:** Reconnect the Remote (HTTP) server in Settings; confirm the Cloud MCP server is **Healthy** and the OAuth grant is still valid.
- **Connector not available in chat:** Ensure it’s toggled on in **Settings → Connectors** and that you’ve authorized it.
- **Ambiguous tool routing:** In your prompt, explicitly say *which* tool to use for *which* sub-task. Avoid enabling unnecessary connectors/tools for a session.

---

## 7) Privacy & access notes

- Cloud MCP keeps your MCP server behind **OAuth**; Claude receives only tool responses.
- Disable any connector you don’t need for a session.

---

## 8) Where to go next

- Add more MCP servers to Cloud MCP (e.g., research, code intelligence, browsers).
- Create **small, purpose-built** prompts that map cleanly to a tool or connector.
- Save a “starter chat” template in your team wiki with the exact toggles and prompt you use for repeatable tasks.
