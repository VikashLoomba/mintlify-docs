> **TL;DR** — Agents don’t fail because they can’t call tools; they fail because we dump *all the tools* into the prompt at once. **Cloud MCP Router** adds a progressive, discovery‑driven layer in front of your MCP servers so the model sees *only what it needs, when it needs it*. Smaller prompts, fewer mis‑selections, and the ability to scale past arbitrary tool caps—without rewriting your existing MCP servers.

## The problem we’re solving

Modern agents juggle calendars, email, docs, CRMs, repos, issues, and PRs. Hand the model 80–200 tools at once and you get:

* **Context overload:** Tool schemas crowd out user content and inflate token cost.
* **Decision paralysis:** Long, look‑alike tool lists cause mis‑selections and retries.
* **Arbitrary caps:** Teams hide tools just to keep prompts short—shrinking what agents can actually do.

This pattern is especially acute in **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** ecosystems designed for rich, tool‑heavy workflows. The result: your “power user” assistant never reaches its potential because the tool layer isn’t designed for discovery.

## Meet Cloud MCP Router

**Cloud MCP Router** is a progressive, discovery‑driven layer that sits in front of your existing MCP servers (official, custom, or community) and turns any large toolset into a *query‑as‑you‑go* catalog. Instead of spraying every tool and schema into the base prompt, it exposes a small set of **router tools** that guide the agent through staged narrowing—only surfacing schemas at the moment of execution. 

### What the model sees

* **Start with discovery:** `discover_server_actions` returns just the *relevant* actions (by intent), not entire schemas.
* **Drill in on demand:** `get_action_details` reveals parameters only for the chosen action.
* **Execute confidently:** `execute_action` runs with the now‑known parameters (with elicitation automatically bridged).
* **Stay unblocked:** `search_documentation` fetches the smallest useful doc snippets.

## How it works (under the hood)

### 1) Collision‑safe proxying of *any* MCP server

Point the Router at remote MCP servers (stdio) and it will connect, list their tools/prompts/resources, and **proxy** them through a clean namespace. It sanitizes and uniquifies names, enforces length limits, and pre‑checks for collisions before exposing anything to the client—so your model never sees confusing duplicates. 

> **Why that matters:** Tools stay stable and human‑readable, even across many vendors and teams. No more “mystery collisions” that silently break calls.

### 2) **Router‑only mode** to shrink the prompt on demand

Flip **router‑only mode** and the Router removes all proxied tools from the surface area, leaving only the small, discovery‑first router tools. When you’re ready, you can selectively re‑enable a subset of actions or whole servers—and still avoid overload. Toggle via the `Router-Mode` switch on your dashboard. 

### 3) Progressive discovery & execution API (the “router tools”)

* `discover_server_actions` — intent → relevant actions (fast, ranked).
* `get_action_details` — reveal schema *only* for the chosen action.
* `execute_action` — call the remote tool; **elicitation** is automatically bridged back to the upstream client session so the agent can ask follow‑ups mid‑execution without losing context. 

### 4) Resources & prompts, too

Beyond tools, the Router proxies **resources** (with stable `proxy://…` URIs) and **prompts**, keeping names safe and avoiding collisions across servers. It even installs a catch‑all resource template so ad‑hoc reads “just work.” 

### 5) Auth that fits your stack

The Router protects its MCP endpoint with **OAuth2** authentication against your Cloud MCP endpoint. It also publishes **well‑known protected resource metadata** so compliant clients know how to authorize. You get modern headers and correct `WWW-Authenticate` challenges out of the box.

## Why customers adopt Cloud MCP Router

* **Smaller prompts, lower cost:** Only a tiny subset of metadata is surfaced at any moment.
* **Fewer mistakes:** Staged, ranked choices beat a flat list of 100+ tools.
* **Scale past arbitrary caps:** Because schemas are fetched lazily, catalogs can grow to *hundreds* of actions without overwhelming the model.
* **Keep your stack:** No rewrites required—just add your existing MCP servers and go.  
* **Built‑in resilience:** Doc search and auth‑recovery tools unstick agents without inflating the base prompt. 
* **Operational sanity:** Health checks, safe namespacing, and collision detection remove brittle edges before they reach production.

## Example: What the agent’s loop looks like

1. **Discover:** “Open a PR that closes issue #123” → Router returns relevant actions like `repos.create_pull_request`, `issues.update`, ranked by intent. 
2. **Detail:** Model asks details for `repos.create_pull_request`; Router returns just that action’s schema. 
3. **Execute:** Model calls `execute_action` with the filled parameters; if extra info is needed mid‑call, elicitation is bridged back to the client session seamlessly. 

**Net effect:** The base prompt stays lean. The agent makes better choices. Your catalog can grow without fear.

## Security & enterprise readiness

* **Session‑verified access tokens** (via Cloud MCP).
* **Correct `WWW-Authenticate` challenges** and **.well‑known metadata** for resource authorization.
