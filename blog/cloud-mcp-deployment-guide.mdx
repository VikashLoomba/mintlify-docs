# How to Deploy an MCP Server on CloudMCP.run

Deploying an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server on CloudMCP.run is designed to be quick and straightforward. In this guide, we'll walk you through the entire process from finding a server to having it deployed and running in production.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- A cloudmcp.run account (sign up with GitHub at [cloudmcp.run](https://cloudmcp.run))
- Basic understanding of what MCP servers do
- Any required API keys or credentials for the server you want to deploy

## Step 1: Find Your MCP Server

Start by navigating to the "Find Servers" page from your dashboard. Here you can browse our registry of available MCP servers or import your own from a GitHub repository.

You can:
- **Search the registry**: Type keywords to find servers that match your needs (e.g., "desktop-commander", "filesystem", "database")
- **Import your own**: Click the "Import Server" button to link your own GitHub repository
- **Bookmark/Save Servers**: Click the bookmark icon on any server card to save it to your personal library for easy access later

For this guide, we'll deploy the popular `@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander` server, which gives Claude terminal control and file system access.

## Step 2: Browse and Save Servers

Once you've found servers you're interested in, they'll appear in your "Saved Servers" section. This is your personal library of MCP servers ready to deploy.

From this view, you can:
- See your deployed servers
- See all your saved servers with their descriptions
- Check the package name and version
- View when each server was saved
- Click "Deploy Server" to begin deployment

Each server card shows:
- **Package name**: The npm package or GitHub repository
- **Version**: Current version or branch
- **Description**: What the server does
- **Save date**: When you added it to your library

## Step 3: Configure Your Deployment

Click "Deploy Server" on your chosen server to open the deployment configuration modal.

### Configuration Options:

#### Deployment Name
Give your deployment a unique, descriptive name. This helps you identify it later, especially if you deploy the same server multiple times with different configurations.

#### Command
The command to run your server. Common options:
- `npx` - For npm packages (most common)
- `node` - For custom scripts
- `python` - For Python-based servers

#### Arguments
The specific package or script to run. For npm packages, this is typically:
- `-y @package-name` (the `-y` flag skips npm prompts)

#### Environment Variables
Add any required configuration:
- API keys
- Database connection strings
- Custom settings
- Authentication tokens

> 🔒 **Security Tip**: Environment variables are encrypted and never exposed in logs or the UI after creation.

### Example Configuration

For the desktop-commander server:
- **Deployment Name**: `desktop-commander`
- **Command**: `npx`
- **Arguments**: `-y @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander`
- **Environment Variables**: (Add any required API keys or settings)

Click "Deploy" when you're ready to launch your server.

## Step 4: Monitor Your Deployment

After clicking deploy, you'll be redirected to your deployments page where you can monitor the status of your server.

### Deployment Details:

Your deployed server card shows:
- **Status indicator**: Green dot for active, yellow for deploying, red for stopped
- **Deployment date**: When the server was deployed
- **Description**: What the server does
- **Package info**: The underlying package being run
- **Server URL**: Your unique endpoint (e.g., `https://2976130-e28603...`)

### Available Actions:

- **Copy URL**: Click the copy icon next to the server URL to copy it to your clipboard
- **Install in VSCode**: 1-click install directly into VSCode with OAuth authentication
- **Stop**: Shut down and delete the server 

## Step 5: Connect Your MCP Client

Now that your server is deployed, you can connect to it from any MCP-compatible client.

### For Configuration-file Based Clients:

1. Copy your server URL from the deployment card
2. In your MCP client configuration, add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "desktop-commander": {
      "url": "https://your-server-url.cloudmcp.run"
    }
  }
}
```

3. Restart your client to connect to the server

### Testing Your Connection

Once connected, you can test your server:
- For desktop-commander: Try asking Claude to list files or run terminal commands
- For database servers: Query your connected database
- For API servers: Make requests to your configured endpoints

## Managing Your Deployments

Click on your deployment card to view:
- 1-click VSCode MCP installation.
- Performance metrics* (soon!)
- Stop action

### Scaling and Performance

CloudMCP.run automatically handles:
- **Auto-scaling**: Servers scale based on demand
- **Load balancing**: Requests are distributed efficiently
- **Failover**: Automatic recovery from crashes
- **Caching**: Improved response times for repeated requests

## Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive names**: Make it easy to identify deployments
2. **Stop unused servers**: Save resources by stopping inactive deployments

## Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start
- Check your environment variables are correctly formatted
- Verify the package name and version
- Review deployment logs for error messages

### Connection Issues
- Ensure your server URL is correctly copied
- Check that your client supports the MCP version
- Verify network connectivity

### Performance Problems
- Check server logs for errors
- Consider upgrading your plan for more resources
- Contact support if issues persist

## Advanced Features

### Multiple Deployments

You can deploy the same server multiple times with different configurations:
- Different environment variables
- Separate instances for development/production
- Isolated deployments for different projects

### Custom Servers

Import your own MCP servers from GitHub:
1. Click "Import Server" on the Find Servers page
2. Enter your GitHub repository URL
3. Configure and deploy like any other server
